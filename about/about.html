				<h2 class="text-left p-4">About Me</h1>
				<p>Looking for a career-change, I have taught myself the basics of front-end programming.</p><br>
				<p>My first proper introduction into programming was with Python, although I soon migrated over to learning JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS. Learning fundamental programming concepts was challenging, but rewarding. Not long after, having learnt more about the programming landscape, and keen to get working in the browser, wanting to learn front-end, I migrated to JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
				<p>After sampling a few different online resources, including freecodecamp, I settled with Team Treehouse as a learning provider, as I liked its teaching style, and teachers. After the initial hand-holding phase, I became acutely aware of how little I know, and  few months  fundamentals, whilst simaltaneously overwhelemed by how much I didn't know,ntal concepts such as variables, functions and loops, conditional statements, gradually things began to make more sense. Having gotten through feeling overwhelmed by the range of languages, concepts, frameworks and libraries, as well as the sheer amount that I didn't know (it took me quite a while to get my head around exactly a library was), bit bit by things started falling into place. Gradually, as my rate of learning began to improve, that feeling of overwhelm was replaced with a sense of curiousity and confidence that I could figure out whatever I needed to, eventually. </p><br>
				<p>I slowly became to think like a programmer, and I found myself seeing conditional statements everywhere, both in digital technologies and in real-life. I found myself waking up with thoughts of how to better approach a problem in my current project.</p><br>
				<p>When I started, the never-ending acronyms and abstract technologies was boggling, however I gradually figured out a path of frameworks and libraries I wanted to learn. I became increasingly more comfortable not knowing everything, and the learning became addictive. Torn between wanting to learn everything, and needing to focus, I slowly absorbed the basics of a variety of tools that I distinctly remember thinking, not so long ago, wow, I can't wait to learn jQuery (what the hell is that?), Bootstrap and AJAX. When I then starting learning about each one, I realised how far I had come. Granted the road ahead is never-ending, but the process of learning, I understand now, is part of the charm of programming.</p><br>
				<p class="pb-3 mb-2">I liken this process to stumbling through the dark, gradually, piece-by-piece you can see slightly more each day and week passes.</p>

thought logs - you know you're a programmer when you cackle maniacally after finally catching a bug, missing a single character or piece of syntax

write basic probram, got it working ,then time to refactor, to make it readable, maintanable and more polished
