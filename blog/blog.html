					<h5 class="card-title">The humble beginnings of a programmer...</h5>
					<p class="mt-4">Looking for a career-change, I have taught myself the basics of front-end programming. Whilst my original introduction to programming was creating a simple HTML website when I was 16, several years later, I have found myself drawn back into programming.</p><br>
					<p>This time around, my first proper introduction into programming was with Python, although I soon migrated over to learning JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS. After frustrating months of battling with fundamental concepts such as variables, functions and loops, conditional statements, gradually things began to make more sense. Having gotten through feeling overwhelmed by the range of languages, concepts, frameworks and libraries, as well as the sheer amount that I didn't know (it took me quite a while to get my head around exactly a library was), bit bit by things started falling into place. Gradually, as my rate of learning began to improve, that feeling of overwhelm was replaced with a sense of curiousity and confidence that I could figure out whatever I needed to, eventually. </p><br>
					<p>I slowly became to think like a programmer, and I found myself seeing conditional statements everywhere, both in digital technologies and in real-life. I found myself waking up with thoughts of how to better approach a problem in my current project.</p><br>
					<p>When I started, the never-ending acronyms and abstract technologies was boggling, however I gradually figured out a path of frameworks and libraries I wanted to learn. I became increasingly more comfortable not knowing everything, and the learning became addictive. Torn between wanting to learn everything, and needing to focus, I slowly absorbed the basics of a variety of tools that I distinctly remember thinking, not so long ago, wow, I can't wait to learn jQuery (what the hell is that?), Bootstrap and AJAX. When I then starting learning about each one, I realised how far I had come. Granted the road ahead is never-ending, but the process of learning, I understand now, is part of the charm of programming.</p><br>
					<p class="pb-3 mb-2">I liken this process to stumbling through the dark, gradually, piece-by-piece you can see slightly more each day and week passes.</p>
					
					<p class="card-text">What exactly is a function? What's an object?</p>
					<p class="card-text">It's common to feel stuck when coding, since solving problems is the very essence of programming. During these times, when you feel as though you'll never get to grips with the current language, framework or library you are focused on,

					<h5 class="card-title">The Wonder of JQuery</h5>
					<p class="card-text">This is an exciting post - to know enough about JavaScript to be able to appreciate the utility of JQuery.</p>
					<p>JQuery is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries. It serves two main purposes: 1) It provides extensive cross-browswer support. 2) It simplifies so much JavaScript code with shorthand.</p>
					<p>Take, for example, an AJAX request. In vanilla (plain) JavaScript, it would take this many lines of code to make a request:</p>
					<code>
						var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
						request.open('GET', 'someaddress.com/file.json');
						request.onload = function () {
							var results = JSON.parse(request.responseText)
							console.log(results)
						}
						request.send();

thought logs - you know you're a programmer when you cackle maniacally after finally catching a bug, missing a single character or piece of syntax

write basic probram, got it working ,then time to refactor, to make it readable, maintanable and more polished
