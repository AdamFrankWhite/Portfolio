						<!-- <h5 class="card-title">Declarative Programming - a very useful concept</h5> -->
						<!-- <p class="card-text">Declarative Programming is all about making life easier for all programmers. Remember, you aren't going to be the only one looking at your code, so it needs to be easy to understand. We all know after a couple of hours of heaving programming, looking at a jumbled, cryptic mess of code is exhausting, compared to code that's easy to read and understand.</p> -->
            <!-- <p>Declarative programming is about making the code speak for itself.Let's take a simple example.Here is a code snippet hiding an error message:</p> -->
            <!-- <code> -->
            <!-- $('#error').css({'visibility':'hidden'}); -->
            <!-- </code> -->
            <!-- <p>Yes, in this simple example, understanding this simple JQuery method isn't too difficult.But what about this piece of code?</p> -->
            <!-- <code> -->
            <!-- hideError(); -->
            <!-- </code> -->
            <!-- <p>We can't get much simpler than that, can we? By placing our code in its own function, not only do we make our code more maintainable, but we simplify the reading of our code.</p> -->
            <!-- <p>Imagine if your code was ten times more complicated, declarative programming would make the world of difference in reading an understanding more complex code.</p> -->

						<h5 class="card-title">The Wonder that is StackOverflow...</h5>
						<p class="pb-3">If there were wonders of the internet-world, Wikipedia would probably be one. If there were wonders of the programming world, StackOverflow would be certainly be one. Like the Oracle of Delphi, if you ask StackOverflow a programming question, fellow programmers will respond with a wise answer (usually several, ranked in order of votes).</p>
						<span class="read-more">read more...</span>
						<span class="main-text">
							<p class="pb-3">As a programmer, you'd better get used to getting stuck. If you become good at identifying your problem and formulating an appropriate question (using the correct terminology), you can usually figure most things out. Google your problem and you will almost certainly find someone else having encountered the same problem, along with excellent advice on how to solve it. If you can't find it, you can then ask fellow programmers on StackOverflow directly.</p>
							<p class="pb-3">Here are some random recent searches I have made:</p>
							<ul class="list-group-flush mb-4">
								<li class="list-group-item">"jQuery parent() does not work"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"javascript set object key with variable"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"adding event listeners to dynamically created element javascript"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"how to float nav items right but keep order"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"accessing ajax response data"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"highlighting menu item when scrolling javascript"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"parseerror adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"XMLHttpRequest blocked by CORS policy"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"addeventlistener in for loop always adds last item"</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="pb-3">As you can see, so long as you are precise in your query, you generally find a solution. I have learned so much from reading and absorbing the advice of other programmers. By connecting programmers of all types and all of their problems, StackOverflow is a powerful resource - without it, learning to programming would undoubtedly be several orders of magnitude more difficult.</p>

						<h5 class="card-title">The humble beginnings of a programmer...</h5>
						<p class="mt-4 pb-3">Looking for a career-change, I decided to teach myself the basics of front-end programming. Whilst my original introduction to programming was creating a simple HTML website when I was 16, several years later, I found myself drawn back into programming.</p>
            <span class="read-more">read more...</span>
						<span class="main-text">
              <p class="pb-3">This time around, my first proper introduction into programming was with Python. Starting from scratch, with Team Treehouse holding my hand, I began to learn about variables, functions, loops and conditional statements. At this stage, knowing absolutely nothing, learning how to think programmatically learning took some time.<p>
							<p class="pb-3"> I could soon follow along reasonably well, and could tweak scaffolded code, although when placed in front of a blank editor, I was completely lost. It was at this point, eager to move into web development, I decided to focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
							<p class="pb-3"> Initially confused at a change in language, I soon became more comfortable reading and writing code. Following advice I had often heard, I began to build my own 'projects'. Using freecodecamp as a launching pad, as well as Team Treehouse,  I began to create my first div containers, floated elements, stylesheets and, eventually, basic web pages. and CSS.</p>
							<p class="pb-3">As time went by, and after more practice, things began to make more sense. Whilst I initially felt overwhelmed by the range of languages, concepts, frameworks and libraries, as well as the sheer amount that I didn't know (it took me quite a while to get my head around exactly a library was), bit bit by things started falling into place.</p>
							<p class="pb-3">The most crucial skill I learned was the skill of learning itself. As I became more familiar with my chosen languages, my rate of learning began to improve and the speed at which I picked up new concepts increased. That feeling of being overwhelmed was replaced with a sense of curiousity and confidence that I could figure out whatever I needed to, eventually. </p>
              <p class="pb-3">I slowly began to think like a programmer, and I found myself seeing conditional statements everywhere, both in digital technologies, games, and in real-life. I found myself waking up with thoughts of how to better approach a problem in my current project. This is when I realised I had found the career for me. </p>
							<p class="pb-3">Looking back, when I first started the never-ending acronyms and abstract technologies were intimidating. Nonetheless, I gradually figured out a path of frameworks and libraries that I wanted to learn. I became increasingly more comfortable not knowing everything, and the learning became addictive. Torn between wanting to learn everything, and needing to focus, I slowly absorbed the basics of a variety of tools including JQuery, AJAX, and Bootstrap. When I then starting learning about each one, I reminded myself that not so long ago, they were just abstract names, and that I now had a working knowledge of them. I understand now that never-ending learning is part of the charm of programming.</p>

						<h5 class="card-title">What's so special about JQuery?</h5>
						<p class="pb-3"><i>Personal note - this is an exciting post. To know enough about JavaScript to be able to appreciate the utility of JQuery.</i></p>
						<p class="pb-3">JQuery is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries. It serves two main purposes:</p>
						<p class="h6 pb-3">1) JQuery provides extensive cross-browser support.</p>
						<p class="pb-3">Cross-browswer support may not be glamorous, but taking out the hassle of making sure your code runs on different broswers is very useful.</p>
						<p class="h6 pb-3">2) It simplifies so much JavaScript code with shorthand methods.</h2>
						<p class="pb-3">These shorthand methods help simplify DOM traversal and manipulation, event handling, AJAX, and animation.</p> 
						<span class="read-more">read more...</span>	
						<span class="main-text">
							<p class="pb-3">Take, for example, an AJAX request. In vanilla (plain) JavaScript, it would take this many lines of code to make a request:</p>
							<code class="pb-3">
								var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
								request.open('GET', 'someaddress.com/file.json');
								request.onload = function () {
								<span class="ml-4">var results = JSON.parse(request.responseText);</span>
								<span class="ml-4">//do something with results;</span>
								}
								request.send();						
							</code>
							<p class="pb-3">However, with jQuery, an AJAX request is more streamlined:</p>
							<code>
								var $request = $.ajax({
								<span class="ml-4">url: "http://www.json-generator.com/api/json/get/coSwXiWUky?indent=2",</span>
								<span class="ml-4">success: function(result){</span>
								<span class="ml-5">data = result; // assign results to variable</span>
								<span class="ml-5">// do stuff with result</span>
									}
								});
							</code>
							<p class="pb-3">Rather that creating a XMLHttpRequest object, then opening a request, adding a callback function, then sending the question, with JQuery, we supply the data as an obect, and JQuery does the rest!</p>
							<p class="pb-3">As for compatibility, as well as checking caniuse.com for whatever property or feature you are trying to implement, jQuery offers well-supported cross-browser compability, and should be taken full advantage of.</p>

						<h5 class="card-title">Developer Tools - your greatest ally</h5>
						<p class="card-text">When it comes to designing web pages, Developer Tools (aka DevTools) is a powerful tool to help you design web pages and apps, as well as helping you make responsive sites. In Chrome, on the far left of the tool bar, there are two buttons. The first toggles the element selector, useful for navigating your page's DOM, helping you to visualise padding and margins.</p>
						<p> Next to this button is the device toolbar, which helps you to visualise your design on different devices and screen sizes. Whilst ideally you would test your site on different sized devices in real-life, nonetheless, this gives you are good idea of how your site will looks on different sized screens. Also, it's unlikely you'll have every single mobile and tablet device laying around to test manually!</p>

						<p class="card-text">When designing a site or app, there are always so many things to do, and without adequate organisation, it is easy to get lost, overwhelmed, and make mistakes - mistakes that could cause a lot of hassle further down the line.</p>
            <p>This is where organisational tools like Trello and Jira come into play. Whilst Jira is specifically meant for developers to use, Trello is also really useful. By breaking your project up into small tasks, you don't have to waste time and precious mental resources remembering what you need to do, or forgetting it!</p>
            <p>When I first started using Trello to organise my work, the benefit was hugely noticeable. My stress went down and my productivity went up.</p>

						<p class="card-text">Bootstrap is a front-end framework, designed by the folks behind Twitter. It is a useful tool, providing simple shortcuts and code snippets to help speed up your designing, and provide uniformity. However, it does have its drawbacks. </p>
            <p>Some designers swear by it, others swear off it. As for me, whilst at first I found it really useful - its speed and ease is great - unfortunately, I found that once I wanted to customise my designs more and tweak my own custom css stylesheet, it became a pain having to create super-specific selectors to take precedence over Bootstrap's own stylesheet.</p>
