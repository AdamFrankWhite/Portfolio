						<h5 class="card-title">Declarative Programming vs Imperative programming</h5>
						<p>Declarative Programming is all about making life easier for programmers.</p>
						<p class="pb-3">Here's the difference between the two:</p>
						<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Declarative programming is code that describes <em>what</em> you are doing.</li>
							<li>Imperative programming is code that describes <em>how</em> you are doing something.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="pb-3">Declarative program takes up fewer lines of code and is easier to read - because the code describes itself. Conversely, imperative programming takes up more lines of code, and is harder to read at a glance, because you have to decipher what it is that particulary code block is doing. Wouldn't it be easier if the code could speak for itself? Enter, declarative programming.</p>
						<span class="read-more">read more...</span>
						<span class="main-text">
							<p class="pb-3">Declarative programming has become increasinly popular as a method of programming, which is evident from the prevalance of libraries such as React and jQuery, as well as JavaScript's map, filter and reduce methods. Let's look at an example.</p>
							<p class="pb-3">Remember, you aren't going to be the only one looking at your code, so it needs to be easy to understand. We all know after a couple of hours of heaving programming, looking at a jumbled, cryptic mess of code is exhausting, compared to code that's easy to read and understand.</p>
							<p class="pb-3">Declarative programming is about making the code speak for itself. Let's look at an example. Say you had an array of integers that you wanted to add together:</p>
							<code class="pl-3 pb-3 mb-2">
							let myArray = [3, 5, 6, 3, 7, 9];
							</code>
							<p class="pb-3">Traditionally, we would solve this problem imperatively, by looping through the array, cumulatively adding each item to a count variable:</p>
							<code class="pl-3 pb-3 mb-2">
							let myArray = [3, 5, 6, 3, 7, 9];
							let total = 0;
							
							for (let i=0; i&lt;myArray.length; i++) {
								total += myArray[i]
							}
							console.log(total) // 33
							</code>
							<p class="pb-3">Our code does the job, but it's not that easy to read. Imagine if our program was 1000 times more complicated - we'd spend a lot of time and brainpower trying to understand what our code does. </p>
							<p class="pb-3"> What about a more declarative approach? If we use the reduce method, our code for the above problem would look like this:</p>
							<code class="pl-2 pr-1 pb-3 mb-2">
							let myArray = [3, 5, 6, 3, 7, 9];
							let total = myArray.reduce( (total, num) => total + num, 0);
							
							console.log(total) // 33
							</code>
							<p class="pb-3">In this example, the reduce method takes two arguments - num (each item) and sum (the running total), which is initialized to 0 at the end of the method. It then iterates through myArray, applying our code to each one. Notice though, that this is all done under the hood, behind the scenes. By abstracting the details away, our code is becomes easier to deal with. As you can see, not only does this take fewer lines of code, but it's easier to understand - we can clearly see we are <i>reducing</i> our array to its sum.</p>
							<p class="pb-3">Now, imagine if your code was a thousand times more complicated - declarative programming would make the task much more managable.</p>

						<h5 class="card-title">The Wonder that is StackOverflow...</h5>
						<p class="pb-3">If there were wonders of the internet-world, Wikipedia would probably be one. If there were wonders of the programming world, StackOverflow would be certainly be one. Like the Oracle of Delphi, if you ask StackOverflow a programming question, fellow programmers will respond with a wise answer (usually several, ranked in order of votes).</p>
						<span class="read-more">read more...</span>
						<span class="main-text">
							<p class="pb-3">As a programmer, you'd better get used to getting stuck. If you become good at identifying your problem and formulating an appropriate question (using the correct terminology), you can usually figure most things out. Google your problem and you will almost certainly find someone else having encountered the same problem, along with excellent advice on how to solve it. If you can't find it, you can then ask fellow programmers on StackOverflow directly.</p>
							<p class="pb-3">Here are some random recent searches I have made:</p>
							<ul class="list-group-flush mb-4">
								<li class="list-group-item">"jQuery parent() does not work"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"javascript set object key with variable"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"adding event listeners to dynamically created element javascript"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"how to float nav items right but keep order"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"accessing ajax response data"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"highlighting menu item when scrolling javascript"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"parseerror adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"XMLHttpRequest blocked by CORS policy"</li>
								<li class="list-group-item">"addeventlistener in for loop always adds last item"</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="pb-3">As you can see, so long as you are precise in your query, you generally find a solution. I have learned so much from reading and absorbing the advice of other programmers. By connecting programmers of all types and all of their problems, StackOverflow is a powerful resource - without it, learning to programming would undoubtedly be several orders of magnitude more difficult.</p>

						<h5 class="card-title">The humble beginnings of a programmer...</h5>
						<p class="mt-4 pb-3">Looking for a career-change, I decided to teach myself the basics of front-end programming. Whilst my original introduction to programming was creating a simple HTML website when I was 16, several years later, I found myself drawn back into programming.</p>
            <span class="read-more">read more...</span>
						<span class="main-text">
              <p class="pb-3">This time around, my first proper introduction into programming was with Python. Starting from scratch, with Team Treehouse holding my hand, I began to learn about variables, functions, loops and conditional statements. At this stage, knowing absolutely nothing, learning how to think programmatically learning took some time.<p>
							<p class="pb-3"> I could soon follow along reasonably well, and could tweak scaffolded code, although when placed in front of a blank editor, I was completely lost. It was at this point, eager to move into web development, I decided to focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
							<p class="pb-3"> Initially confused at a change in language, I soon became more comfortable reading and writing code. Following advice I had often heard, I began to build my own 'projects'. Using freecodecamp as a launching pad, as well as Team Treehouse,  I began to create my first div containers, floated elements, stylesheets and, eventually, basic web pages. and CSS.</p>
							<p class="pb-3">As time went by, and after more practice, things began to make more sense. Whilst I initially felt overwhelmed by the range of languages, concepts, frameworks and libraries, as well as the sheer amount that I didn't know (it took me quite a while to get my head around exactly a library was), bit bit by things started falling into place.</p>
							<p class="pb-3">The most crucial skill I learned was the skill of learning itself. As I became more familiar with my chosen languages, my rate of learning began to improve and the speed at which I picked up new concepts increased. That feeling of being overwhelmed was replaced with a sense of curiousity and confidence that I could figure out whatever I needed to, eventually. </p>
              <p class="pb-3">I slowly began to think like a programmer, and I found myself seeing conditional statements everywhere, both in digital technologies, games, and in real-life. I found myself waking up with thoughts of how to better approach a problem in my current project. This is when I realised I had found the career for me. </p>
							<p class="pb-3">Looking back, when I first started the never-ending acronyms and abstract technologies were intimidating. Nonetheless, I gradually figured out a path of frameworks and libraries that I wanted to learn. I became increasingly more comfortable not knowing everything, and the learning became addictive. Torn between wanting to learn everything, and needing to focus, I slowly absorbed the basics of a variety of tools including JQuery, AJAX, and Bootstrap. When I then starting learning about each one, I reminded myself that not so long ago, they were just abstract names, and that I now had a working knowledge of them. I understand now that never-ending learning is part of the charm of programming.</p>

						<h5 class="card-title">What's so special about JQuery?</h5>
						<p class="pb-3"><i>Personal note - this is an exciting post. To know enough about JavaScript to be able to appreciate the utility of JQuery.</i></p>
						<p class="pb-3">JQuery is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries. It serves two main purposes:</p>
						<p class="h6 pb-3">1) JQuery provides extensive cross-browser support.</p>
						<p class="pb-3">Cross-browswer support may not be glamorous, but taking out the hassle of making sure your code runs on different broswers is very useful.</p>
						<p class="h6 pb-3">2) It simplifies so much JavaScript code with shorthand methods.</h2>
						<p class="pb-3">These shorthand methods help simplify DOM traversal and manipulation, event handling, AJAX, and animation.</p> 
						<span class="read-more">read more...</span>	
						<span class="main-text">
							<p class="pb-3">Take, for example, an AJAX request. In vanilla (plain) JavaScript, it would take this many lines of code to make a request:</p>
							<code class="pb-3">
								var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
								request.open('GET', 'someaddress.com/file.json');
								request.onload = function () {
								<span class="ml-4">var results = JSON.parse(request.responseText);</span>
								<span class="ml-4">//do something with results;</span>
								}
								request.send();						
							</code>
							<p class="pb-3">However, with jQuery, an AJAX request is more streamlined:</p>
							<code>
								var $request = $.ajax({
								<span class="ml-4">url: "http://www.json-generator.com/api/json/get/coSwXiWUky?indent=2",</span>
								<span class="ml-4">success: function(result){</span>
								<span class="ml-5">data = result; // assign results to variable</span>
								<span class="ml-5">// do stuff with result</span>
									}
								});
							</code>
							<p class="pb-3">Rather that creating a XMLHttpRequest object, then opening a request, adding a callback function, then sending the question, with JQuery, we supply the data as an obect, and JQuery does the rest!</p>
							<p class="pb-3">As for compatibility, as well as checking caniuse.com for whatever property or feature you are trying to implement, jQuery offers well-supported cross-browser compability, and should be taken full advantage of.</p>

						<h5 class="card-title">Dev Tools - your greatest ally</h5>
						<p class="pb-3">When it comes to designing web pages, Developer Tools (aka DevTools) is a powerful tool to help you design web pages and apps, as well as helping you make responsive sites. In Chrome, on the far left of the tool bar, there are two buttons. The first toggles the element selector, useful for navigating your page's DOM, helping you to visualise padding and margins.</p>
						<p class="pb-3"> Next to this button is the device toolbar, which helps you to visualise your design on different devices and screen sizes. Whilst ideally you would test your site on different sized devices in real-life, nonetheless, this gives you are good idea of how your site will looks on different sized screens. Also, it's unlikely you'll have every single mobile and tablet device laying around to test manually!</p>
