						<h5 class="card-title">Declarative Programming - a very useful concept</h5>
						<p class="card-text">Declarative Programming is all about making life easier for all programmers. Remember, you aren't going to be the only one looking at your code, so it needs to be easy to understand. We all know after a couple of hours of heaving programming, looking at a jumbled, cryptic mess of code is exhausting, compared to code that's easy to read and understand.</p>
            <p>Declarative programming is about making the code speak for itself.Let's take a simple example.Here is a code snippet hiding an error message:</p>
            <code>
            $('#error').css({'visibility':'hidden'});
            </code>
            <p>Yes, in this simple example, understanding this simple JQuery method isn't too difficult.But what about this piece of code?</p>
            <code>
            hideError();
            </code>
            <p>We can't get much simpler than that, can we? By placing our code in its own function, not only do we make our code more maintainable, but we simplify the reading of our code.</p>
            <p>Imagine if your code was ten times more complicated, declarative programming would make the world of difference in reading an understanding more complex code.</p>

						<h5 class="card-title">The humble beginnings of a programmer...</h5>
						<p class="mt-4">Looking for a career-change, I have taught myself the basics of front-end programming. Whilst my original introduction to programming was creating a simple HTML website when I was 16, several years later, I have found myself drawn back into programming.</p>
            <span class="read-more">read more...</span>
						<span class="main-text">
              <p>This time around, my first proper introduction into programming was with Python, although I soon migrated over to learning JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS. After frustrating months of battling with fundamental concepts such as variables, functions and loops, conditional statements, gradually things began to make more sense. Having gotten through feeling overwhelmed by the range of languages, concepts, frameworks and libraries, as well as the sheer amount that I didn't know (it took me quite a while to get my head around exactly a library was), bit bit by things started falling into place. Gradually, as my rate of learning began to improve, that feeling of overwhelm was replaced with a sense of curiousity and confidence that I could figure out whatever I needed to, eventually. </p><br>
              <p>I slowly became to think like a programmer, and I found myself seeing conditional statements everywhere, both in digital technologies and in real-life. I found myself waking up with thoughts of how to better approach a problem in my current project.</p><br>
              <p>Soon, learning becaming easier. New concepts were still often difficult to understand at first, but the length of the initial "I don't get that at all" phase gradually became shorter, and I found that learning became a little faster than before.</p>
              <p>When I started, the never-ending acronyms and abstract technologies was boggling, however I gradually figured out a path of frameworks and libraries I wanted to learn. I became increasingly more comfortable not knowing everything, and the learning became addictive. Torn between wanting to learn everything, and needing to focus, I slowly absorbed the basics of a variety of tools that I distinctly remember thinking, not so long ago, wow, I can't wait to learn jQuery (what the hell is that?), Bootstrap and AJAX. When I then starting learning about each one, I realised how far I had come. Granted the road ahead is never-ending, but the process of learning, I understand now, is part of the charm of programming.</p><br>
              <p class="pb-3 mb-2">I liken this process to stumbling through the dark, gradually, piece-by-piece you can see slightly more each day and week passes.</p>
              <p class="card-text">What exactly is a function? What's an object?</p>
              <p class="card-text">It's common to feel stuck when coding, since solving problems is the very essence of programming. During these times, when you feel as though you'll never get to grips with the current language, framework or library you are focused on,

						<h5 class="card-title">The Wonder of JQuery</h5>
						<p class="card-text">This is an exciting post - to know enough about JavaScript to be able to appreciate the utility of JQuery.</p>
						<p>JQuery is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries. It serves two main purposes: 1) It provides extensive cross-browswer support. 2) It simplifies so much JavaScript code with shorthand.</p>
						<p>Take, for example, an AJAX request. In vanilla (plain) JavaScript, it would take this many lines of code to make a request:</p>
						<code>
							var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
							request.open('GET', 'someaddress.com/file.json');
							request.onload = function () {
								var results = JSON.parse(request.responseText)
								console.log(results)
							}
							request.send();

						<h5 class="card-title">Developer Tools - your greatest ally</h5>
						<p class="card-text">When it comes to designing web pages, Developer Tools (aka DevTools) is a powerful tool to help you design web pages and apps, as well as helping you make responsive sites. In Chrome, on the far left of the tool bar, there are two buttons. The first toggles the element selector, useful for navigating your page's DOM, helping you to visualise padding and margins.</p>
						<p> Next to this button is the device toolbar, which helps you to visualise your design on different devices and screen sizes. Whilst ideally you would test your site on different sized devices in real-life, nonetheless, this gives you are good idea of how your site will looks on different sized screens. Also, it's unlikely you'll have every single mobile and tablet device laying around to test manually!</p>

						<h5 class="card-title">Getting Organised - using Trello or Jira</h5>
						<p class="card-text">When designing a site or app, there are always so many things to do, and without adequate organisation, it is easy to get lost, overwhelmed, and make mistakes - mistakes that could cause a lot of hassle further down the line.</p>
            <p>This is where organisational tools like Trello and Jira come into play. Whilst Jira is specifically meant for developers to use, Trello is also really useful. By breaking your project up into small tasks, you don't have to waste time and precious mental resources remembering what you need to do, or forgetting it!</p>
            <p>When I first started using Trello to organise my work, the benefit was hugely noticeable. My stress went down and my productivity went up.</p>

						<h5 class="card-title">Bootstrap - to use or not to use....</h5>
						<p class="card-text">Bootstrap is a front-end framework, designed by the folks behind Twitter. It is a useful tool, providing simple shortcuts and code snippets to help speed up your designing, and provide uniformity. However, it does have its drawbacks. </p>
            <p>Some designers swear by it, others swear off it. As for me, whilst at first I found it relaly useful - its speed and ease is great, unfortunately I found that once I wanted to customise my designs more and tweak my own custom css stylesheet, it became a pain having to create super-specific selectors to take precedence over Bootstrap's own stylesheet.</p>
